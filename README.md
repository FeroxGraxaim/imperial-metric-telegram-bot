# WorldWide Brotherhood Telegram BOT

This very simple BOT add resources to make it easier to communicate between people from different countries, like Imperial/Metric bidirectional conversion and currency conversion! In the future more resources may be implemented.

## How to use it

You need to create a BOT in [BotFather](https://t.me/botfather). Afther that, you need to compile the program for your operating system.
* If you are on Windows, put the EXE file in a dedicated folder. And then, run it by double-clicking (it will open on Command Prompt).
* If you are on Linux, you can put in ~/.local/bin and run through terminal anytime with `impmetbot` command!

Then, it will ask you to put the generated token, paste it and then your BOT will be working!

> [!TIP]
> You can change the token anytime by running the program with `impmetbot -u` or `impmetbot --update-token` through Windows CMD or Linux teminal. Try `-h` or `--help`to see all the parse parameters avaliable.
